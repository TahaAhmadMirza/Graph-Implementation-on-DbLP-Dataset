This dataset is a weighted undirected graph representing the number of times
that two nodes co-appeared in a simplex. In other words, it is a 1-mode
projection of a bipartite graph without the diagonal.

The file format is a list of weighted edges, one edge per line:
i j w

The two nodes of the undirected edge are i and j and the weight is w.
